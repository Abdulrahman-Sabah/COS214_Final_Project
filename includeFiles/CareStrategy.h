 * @brief Abstract base class implementing the Strategy pattern for plant care

 * The CareStrategy class defines the interface for different plant care algorithms.
 * This allows the greenhouse system to use different care strategies for different
 * types of plants (e.g., CactusCare, RoseCare, LavenderCare) without changing
 * the plant classes themselves.
 * 
 * Concrete strategies should inherit from this class and implement the applyCare
 * method with plant-specific care logic.
